Product Development Requirements (PDR)
MCP-Auth Resume Genius
Last Updated: July 24, 2025
1. Vision & Mission
Vision: To deliver the world’s most trusted, AI-powered resume builder that empowers job seekers to land their dream jobs.
Mission: We will achieve this by using secure MCP authentication, a human-centric conversational AI for data gathering, and a powerful optimization engine to create resumes that excel against both automated (ATS) and human reviews.
2. Target Audience
* Primary: Tech professionals, career changers, and recent graduates who need to create tailored resumes for multiple job applications.
* Secondary: Career coaches and professional resume writers looking for tools to streamline their workflow.
3. Core Features & User Stories
This section outlines the primary features for the initial release (v1).
F1: Secure User Authentication
* User Story: As a new user, I want to create an account securely using my email and password so that my personal information is safe.
* User Story: As a returning user, I want to log in to access my profile and resume history.
* Technical Requirement: All user-facing API endpoints must be protected. A valid JSON Web Token (JWT) is required in the request header.
F2: Job Description Analyzer
* User Story: As a user, I want to paste a job description into the app so that the AI can analyze it and identify the most important keywords, skills, and qualifications.
* Acceptance Criteria: The system should return a structured list of extracted skills (e.g., "React", "Node.js") and experience levels (e.g., "Senior").
F3: Conversational Q&A Engine
* User Story: As a user, I want the AI to ask me specific questions based on the job analysis so I can provide detailed, relevant examples of my experience.
* Acceptance Criteria: Questions should be based on the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) method to elicit high-quality, quantifiable answers. User answers must be saved to their cloud profile.
F4: AI Resume Generator
* User Story: As a user, I want to click a button to generate a complete resume that is tailored to the job description and uses the detailed answers I provided.
* Acceptance Criteria:
   * The generated resume must be professionally formatted.
   * The language must sound natural and human-written, using varied action verbs and sentence structures.
   * The resume must strategically include keywords from the job analysis.
   * The system should provide a simulated ATS "pass rate" score.
4. System & Technical Requirements
* Security: All data must be encrypted at rest and in transit. Passwords must be hashed using bcryptjs.
* API Design: The API should follow RESTful principles.
* Modularity: The AI components (Parser, Q&A, Generator) should be designed as modular services, allowing for future upgrades or model-swapping without rewriting the entire application.
* Cloud Native: The application must be designed to run in a cloud environment and connect to a cloud-based database (MongoDB Atlas, Supabase, etc.).
5. Success Metrics (KPIs)
The success of the v1 launch will be measured by:
* User Engagement: Number of resumes generated per user.
* ATS Performance: Achieve a target of 90%+ simulated ATS pass rate on generated resumes.
* System Reliability: Maintain 99.9% uptime for the API service.
* Onboarding Time: User can go from login to first generated resume in under 2 minutes.
6. Future Scope (v2 and Beyond)
* Voice and Audio input for the Chat Interface.
* Admin Panel for analytics and user management.
* Automated Self-Healing & Maintenance workflows.
* Direct integration with job application platforms.
